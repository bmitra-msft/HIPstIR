## About

The vision of HIPstIR is that young (at heart) IR researchers getting together to develop a future for non-mainstream ideas and research agendas in information retrieval. Important prior research can be discussed in the form of a reading group. A future vision of what IR should or could be (and how it will get there) will be developed. It is like [SWIRL](https://sites.google.com/view/swirl3/home) in spirit, but focusing on topics that might otherwise be considered "niche", "alternative", "indie", or "left field". 

An explicit goal of the retreat is to foment collaboration and cross-group fertilization. The hope is that participation will give rise to conference workshop topics and joint paper projects.

We primarily focus on young researchers that are anywhere between defending their PhD within 1 year until 1 year into being a tenured professor / senior scientist. We will only invite few senior people.

This is a casual event which is nevertheless intended to be productive and purposeful. No slide presentations are allowed, but a stick and sand will be provided. Attendence will be by invitation. But we are a welcoming bunch--so if you are curious and keen to attend but haven't been invited then drop us a note and we will try our best to accomodate you.

**To those attending, remember you were at HIPstIR before it was cool to do so.**
